# Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help a colleauge named Roza with an unfinished dashboard. Using my knowledge of javascript, html and plotly I was able to successfully create a webpage that allows the user to identify the top 10 bacteria species in the volunteers' belly buttons. 
The user is able to filter this info based on the test subject's ID number. I created 3 different charts for this page: a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart and a gauge chart. When the user selects the test subject's ID number, all three charts are updated with the information on belly button bacteria.

Included in this repository is the "charts.js" javascript file which contains the javascript code I wrote to display these charts. There is also the "index.html" file as well as a JSON file called "samples.json." This JSON file was provided to me prior to my analysis.
